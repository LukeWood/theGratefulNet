Was that lonesome whistle blowing
And a youngun's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I was bound
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried
Was the only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
For the bad I kept on turning
And Mama couldn't hold me anymore
And I turned twenty-one in prison
Doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better
But her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried
Dear old daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
Oh, she tried to raise me right, but I refused
And I turned twenty-one in prison
Doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better
But her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried
