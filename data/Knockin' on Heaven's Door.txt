I won't wear it any more
Now the sun is setting over me
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Come put these guns in the ground
I can't shoot them any more
The sun is going down
And I believe I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Come wipe these tears from my eyes
I can't shed them any more
The sun is setting in the western sky
People, I believe I must be knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Just like so many times before
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Just like so many times before
