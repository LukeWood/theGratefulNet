Fuzzy then and still so obscure (good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye)
And I don't want to see anybody cry
Meet me some morning in the sweet by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye)
Song coming on (your sweet loving bring to me)
So pleasing to see, come and gone (good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye)
You don't have to tell me why
Meet me some morning in the sweet by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye)
It ain't 'cause I'm the only one left, darling
'Bout the time the sun rises west
Feeling groovy, looking fine
Think I'll come back here again
Every now and then, from time to time
My, how lovely you are, my dear
The ball game has gone much too far, my dear
Sing to me, do your thing to me
Meet me some morning now, meet me some morning
In the sweet by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye)
