Gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby
From rolling in your arms
Laid down last night
Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night
Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering
Like the wild geese in the West
The sun will shine
In my back door someday
The sun will shine
In my back door someday
March winds will blow
All my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight
On a north-bound train
I wish I was a headlight
On a north-bound train
I'd shine my light
Through cool Colorado rain
I know you, rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby
From rolling in your arms
I know you, rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby
From rolling in your arms
