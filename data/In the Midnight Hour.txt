That's when my love comes a-tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there's nobody else around
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
Do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
And twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That when my love begins to shine
'Cause you're the only girl I know
That can really love me so
In the midnight hour
