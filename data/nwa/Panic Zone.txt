That's right the panic zone
Some people call it torture
but its what we call home
and your afraid)
I'm the Arabian Prince (and were N.W.A.)
Don't interfere with the sound you here
coz its a dangerous groove
I'm in control of your mind and sole
don't be afraid just bust the moves
So out your home
your on your own
in the land of the unkwown
Its the darkside, the darkside
its called the panic zone

{Dr Dre}
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
there is nothing wrong
The underworld is taking control
we're not only in control of site and sound,
but of mind
Theres a sign posted up here, and it reads
"the panic zone"

{Arabian Prince}
Now the party is at its peek
so we suggest you move your feet
NWA create the groove
and Dr Dre create the beat
so if you got the juice
and your feelin' loose
let the music take your mind
Its the prince you here
dont interfere our world is one of a kind
This place is called the west,
West-Coast of the USA
the panic zone got its base
in a place we call L.A.
So ladies, all the ladies
if your all alone
just call arabian prince
in the panic zone (pa-pa-panic zone)
