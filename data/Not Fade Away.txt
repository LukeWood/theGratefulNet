You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love not fade away
You know my love not fade away
Not fade away
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you, but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
Your gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away
