taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark cryin',
said your love for me was dyin'
Come on babe, baby please
cause I'm beggin' you baby and I'm on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Hey, let shine, let it shine, let it shine
Well I get lonely in the middle of the night
and I need you darlin' to make things all right
So come on babe, baby please
and I'm beggin' you baby and I'm on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Hey, let shine, let it shine, let it shine
Without a warning you broke my heart,
taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark cryin',
said your love for me was dyin'
So come on babe, baby please
and I'm beggin' you baby, I'm on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Hey, let shine, let it shine, let it
A little bit higher
A little bit higher
A little bit higher
Cmon' Get up now
Get up now
Get up now
Get up now
C'mon babe
C'mon babe
C'mon babe
C'mon babe
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
