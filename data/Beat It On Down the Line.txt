xRunning out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning Lord, gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line
I'm going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Beat it on down the line
Yes I'll be waiting at the station Lord, when that train pulls on by
I'm going back where I belong
I'm going back to that same old used-to-be
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine
Yeah, I'm going back to that shack, way across that railroad track
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong
Got a sweet woman, Lord, and she's waiting there for me
And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
That's where I'm gonna make my happy home
