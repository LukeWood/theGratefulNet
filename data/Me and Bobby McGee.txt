Waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
And Bobby flagged a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harp on out of
My dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time
And Bobby clapping hands
We finally sang near-every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for
Nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing
But it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord
When Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From the coal mines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord
In everything I done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas
Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home, I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows
For a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine
Freedom's just another word for
Nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord
When Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
Freedom's just another word for
Nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing
But it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord
When Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
