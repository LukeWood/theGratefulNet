I can give you what you want, but you got to come home with me
I got a whole lot of good old loving, and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on you got to come back for more
Boys and things will come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug-store loving
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now yes I am
Action speaks louder than words, and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so won't you place your ad with me?
Boys and things will come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug-store loving
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now yes I am
Give it to me, I got to have it, some of your love
It's all I need, early in the morning, late in the evening
Baby, here I am, and I'm a man upon the scene
And I can give you what you want, but you gotta come home with me
And I got a whole load of good old loving, and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on, you got to come back for some more
Boys and things will come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug-store loving
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now yes I am
