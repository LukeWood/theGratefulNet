Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the streets
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
New York City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be laughing and singing, music swinging
And dancing in the streets
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
Come on, every guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
This is an invitation across the nation
The chance for folks to meet
There'll be swinging and swaying, music playing
Dancing in the streets
Philadelphia, PA
Baltimore and D.C. now
Can't forget that Motor City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be laughing and singing, music swinging
And dancing in the streets
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets
