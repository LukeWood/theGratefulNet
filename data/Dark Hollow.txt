Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to be in some big city
In a small room with a girl on my mind
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me far on down the track
I'm going away I'm leaving today
Well I'm going but I ain't coming back
I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to see you another man's darling
And to know that you'll never be mine
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me far on down the track
I'm going away I'm leaving today
Well I'm going but I ain't coming back
I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Then to be home alone knowing that you're gone
Would cause me to lose my mind
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me far on down the track
I'm going away I'm leaving today
Well I'm going but I ain't coming back
I'm going away I'm leaving today
Well I'm going but I ain't coming back
