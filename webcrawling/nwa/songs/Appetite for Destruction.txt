I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the "Drop!" 'cause the son caught the slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight up man before they ban the voice
While I ride to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga to run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say is portrayed as negativity
Needs to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack in fact
And take that shit back 'cause they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggaz to try to calm
If mothafuckers could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction -
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit -
Murder in the first degree - a man slaughter
Takin' a life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked up
And the niggaz is killing it's straight fucked up
Whoever saying what I'm saying for greed 
The nine even when they're trying to feed my appetite for destruction

" .. you guys know who I'm talking to .. "


The Appetite is tremendous so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they asked me to end this
Some trouble that I caught 'cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikazi
He took took a swing from my hand - thought I was faded
Start running for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the nine went BANG [shot]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
'cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the nine in my hand
But the average nigga that don't know me don't understand
I'm from the streets so therefore You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real 
niggaz, the niggaz, the niggaz yo
And that's the way the shit gotta go and even so
Any time that the nine wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war 'cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggaz and shoot one more
And that's the million and one They couldn't hang with the appetite
'cause they wasn't rapping right
So I had to destroy whoever was standing in my presence
For fuckin' up the essence appetite for destruction

"Cops putting hurt on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you,
White folks don't believe that shit, don't believe in cops degrading you,
Oh come on, those beatings, those people resisting arrest!?"


Check it out yo, in tha house yo
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin' -
I possess to 10 commandments of the Hip Hop thugster,
Known as the thief and murderer
First one - I'mma die a nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respected breaking mothafuckin' necks
Second one - Alwayz gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snack, crackle and pop
Number three - I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools trying to cause some static
Number four - Here's what's the score
A crazy-ass nigga, that remains hard core
Fifth one - My killing's has just begun
I pull out my gun that will keep me on the run
Step six - Hmmm, it's kinda tricky -
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chicken shit
To the ones who tries to play the E -
By the time you get the seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight - Make no mistake,
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth one - I gotta be raw, 
Fuck any brain once your man made law
Last but not least, I must be real -
Number ten - is my appetite to k...
