Play us a tune 
Something 
To make us all happy 

Do anything 
Take us out of this gloom 
Sing a song, play guitar 
Make it snappy 

You are the one 
Who can make us all laugh 
But doing that 
You break out in tears 

Please don't be sad 
If it was a straight life you had 
We wouldn't have known you 
All these years 

Dear Mister Fantasy 
Play us a tune 
Something 
To make us all happy 

Do anything 
Take us out of this gloom 
Sing a song, play guitar 
Make it snappy 

You are the one 
Who can make us all laugh 
But doing that 
You break out in tears 

Please don't be sad 
If it was a straight life you had 
We wouldn't have known you 
All these years
