At the China Cat Sunflower
Proud-walking jingle 
In the midnight sun

Copper-dome Bodhi 
Drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy-quilt stargown
Through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking 
Through a lace bandana
Like a one-eyed Cheshire
Like a diamond-eye Jack

A leaf of all colors plays
A golden string fiddle
To a double-E waterfall 
Over my back

Comic book colors 
On a violin river
Crying Leonardo words
From out a silk trombone

I rang a silent bell
Beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle wing palace
Of the Queen Chinee
