Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the Devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee, but the Devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight

And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Just might get some sleep tonight
