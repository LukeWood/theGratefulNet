Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
But most of the time they're sitting and crying at home
One of these days they know they got to get going
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me, you got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

Sometimes the light's all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Living on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinking: you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sitting and staring out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin
They just won't let you be

You're sick of hanging around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of traveling and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for trying
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a-going home
Whoa-whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
