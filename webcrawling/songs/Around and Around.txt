Going 'round and 'round
Hey, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

Well, it sounds so sweet 
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat 
Lord, I had to dance
Started moving my feet
While a-clapping my hands

Well, I kept on dancing 
Going 'round and 'round
Hey, reeling and a-rocking 
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

Well, at twelve o'clock 
Lord, the place was packed
The front doors was locked 
Lord, the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors they flew back

Well, I kept on dancing 
Going 'round and 'round
Hey, reeling and a-rocking 
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking 
Till the moon went down
