I wanna love you mama like my easy rider done.
You don't believe I love you look what a fool I've been
You don't believe I'm sinking look what a hole I'm in.
Stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me 
I'm stealin' back my same old used-to-be.
The woman I love she's just my height and size 
Married girl, comes to see me sometimes.
You don't believe I love you what a fool I've been
You don't believe I'm sinking what a hole I'm in.
Stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my same old used-to-be.
Said I'm goin' up north, gonna see my girl
Sweetest thing in this whole wide world
You don't believe I love you look what a fool I've been
You don't believe I'm sinking look what a hole I'm in.
Stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my same old used-to-be.
Stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my same old used-to-be.
