Can't you hear me when I call 
Big boss man 
Can't you hear me when I call 
You ain't so big 
You just tall, that's just about all 

You got me working, boss man 
A-working around the clock 
I want a little drink of whiskey 
You sure won't let me stop 

Call the big boss man 
Can't you hear me when I call 
You ain't so big 
You just tall, that's just about all 

I'm gonna get me a boss man 
A-one gonna treat me right 
I work hard in the daytime 
Sure get stoned at night 

Call big boss man 
Can't you hear me when I call 
You ain't so big 
You just tall, that's just about all
