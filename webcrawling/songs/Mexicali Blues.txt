Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy that wants to shine my feet

And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damned good case of the Mexicali blues, yeah

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the Devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinking and drinking are all I have today

She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know her stage-line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
And all the French perfume you'd care to smell

She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm paying for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali blues

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the Devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinking and drinking are all I have today

Then a man rode in to town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her if I didn't use my gun
And I'd have no one but myself to blame

I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali blues

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hand?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands
